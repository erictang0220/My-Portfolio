## Description
This website is the documentation of my professional experiences and passion in arts. It's also a good practice for me to solidify my web developing skills.

This website is written in React incorporating ideas of a work from a previous [author](https://github.com/tbakerx). I made some modifications to better suit my vision of incorporating my hobby and profession. Some features include the following:
* Adpatation of navigation bar on mobile
* Dynamic background utilizing [particles-bg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/particles-bg)
* Image carasoul inlcuding hover and zoom effect
* Contact Form
